## Loan Data from Prosper

> This dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others. 





## Summary of Findings

> Exploration steps:
 I started Univariate Exploration. I used bar charts for exploration and it became clear through them the employment status (non-employed, retired, self-employed) that recorded the highest risk, while the part-time employee was in the middle. I moved After the Bivariate Exploration stage, many relationships were seen between the features you selected. There is a direct relationship between the increase in the risk rate and the increase in the interest rate, after that I Multivariate Exploration and I noticed that the relationship between the interest rate and the risk rate is direct, while they have an inverse relationship with income, Many graphs such as histogram, heat map and scatterplot were used to discover the relations.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The presentation will be limited to the basic features that are the interest rate and the degree of risk. I will explain the relations between them and their impact on the rest of the variables. I will start by showing a line graph to show the relations between the interest rate and the degree of risk. Then I will show a scatterplot to show the relationships between the interest rate and other variables.
